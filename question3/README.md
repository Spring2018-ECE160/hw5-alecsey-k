## Question 3

(K&R Exercise 5-4) Write the function <code>strend(s,t)</code> which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise. **Be sure to use pointers.** Verify that your function works with at least 3 examples.

Compile Steps:

gcc hw5q3.c -o hw5q3.exe

Output:

s1 = Birthday, t1 = day, result = 1

s2 = Basketball, t2 = bal, result = 0

s3 = Railroad, t3 = road, result = 1
